In the team meeting it was decided that I will implement handle issue #31, and Jake will handle issue #28, since none of the people assigned to it have done it yet. 
We have to discuss pushing back issue #14 to sprint 3 very soon, as it will almost definately need to happen.

Preparing to go into the meeting, compiling a list of reasons why I think that the grid doesn't work
